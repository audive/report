# Abstract
An important step in the autonomization of robots specifically designed for mobility is
Autonomous navigation the ability to navigate 
without the manual control of a human user and crossing obstacles successfully without human
help. We present here a navigation bot which can move autonomosly without any human intervention except in some special cases. We have achieved this using ultrasonic sensors, arduino, python programming language, servos and motors. When the power button is switched on the robot will go straight overcoming the obstacles and when required the bot can be turned using computer with the help of human mind. The whole concept in using human mind to take turns is to make sure that the bot goes in the direction user requires and without much effort of the user.
